Data is stored as documents to an instance of MongoDB running on the server. 
(A new database "indycar" will be created which contains collections "driverinfo", "flaginfo", "runinfo", "trackinfo", "weatherinfo", "telemetry", "sectionresults" and "overallresults".) 

The documents so inserted in these collections can be queried for data retrieval using the DATA API created which can be imported at any other layer of the indycar application.
