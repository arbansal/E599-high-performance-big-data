Project Name: IndyCar - Resolving latency issues of the message flow and implementing the data persistence layer

Summary: The goal of the project is help select an optimal broker service for the IndyCar project to facilitate interaction between different modules and to introduce a data persistence layer (MongoDB) which uses the logs generated during the Indycar race and can be used to store data (by parsing the log records containing telemetry, weather, driver and other race related information and then segregating records based on header and field information) and help in retrieving relevant information from the MongoDB instance which can be served to the different modules of the project (DATA API).
